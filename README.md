# SaveFileAs

A python script to automate docx to pdf file conversion for the 
waterloo works system so that students can quickly upload new documents to 
the internal system by just running the executable from the folder containing 
all their docx files they would like to upload

CURRENT STAGE:
The script works on my machine and automatically converts the most recently 
edited file into the pdf file format into another directory defined by me

FUTURE PLANS:
add functionality for more customization, like custom location directory
and custom file save name, selecting which file to save as pdf by just typing
name into the terminal and maybe a proper UI
